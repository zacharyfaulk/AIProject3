Project Description
Background
o A Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) is an NP-complete problem. A salesman is given a list of cities and a cost to travel between each pair of cities (or a list of city locations). The salesman must select a starting city and visit each city exactly one time and return to the starting city. His problem is to find the route (also known as a Hamiltonian Cycle) that will have the lowest cost. (See http://www.tsp.gatech.edu for more info)

Problem
o Solve an instance of a TSP problem by using a variant of the greedy heuristic
o Build tour by starting with one vertex, and inserting vertices one by one.
o Always insert vertex that is closest to an edge already in tour.
o Data for each problem will be supplied in a .tsp file (a plain text file).
